# SnapX Plugin Runtime (Experimental, known as Snappy)

This project serves as an experimental JavaScript runtime designed for the SnapX application. It is used to evaluate and run plugin scripts written by the community, using modern JavaScript syntax and features.

## Purpose

SnapX is extending its capabilities with a flexible plugin system. This runtime allows plugins to be written in modern ECMAScript (such as ES2025), and executed inside the SnapX environment. This project will eventually support all SnapX plugins and provide a consistent execution context across all platforms.

## JavaScript Support

Plugins are expected to be written in modern ECMAScript (up to ES2025), and then compiled/transpiled down to ECMAScript 2023 before distribution. This allows plugin authors to write future-proof code while ensuring compatibility with the runtime.

It should support:
- ECMAScript 2023 features (e.g., `findLast`, `toSorted`, `Array.prototype.with`, error cause propagation)
- Standard OOP coding with `import` statements across multiple files
- While Jint supports sandboxing, it's unknown how I'd design it yet.
- I want to make sure end users can audit plugin behavior.

## Node.js Compatibility

The goal is to implement a subset of the Node.js core APIs (such as `fs`, `path`, `process`, etc.) to allow bundled modules compiled with tools like Webpack, esbuild, or Rollup to work as expected. This means authors can use standard Node.js libraries as long as they are bundled for runtime execution.

> [!WARNING]
> Not all modules will be implemented, and some may be **polyfilled** or **stubbed**. Use common libraries that gracefully degrade if possible.
> Native Node.js files such as `.node` binaries and arbitrary external code like `.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib` files are not supported.


## Plugin Requirements

All SnapX plugins must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **License**: All plugins must be licensed under **GPL v3 or later** compatible license
- **Source Code**: A link to the plugin’s source code must be provided (preferably hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- All plugin code **must be bundled and transpiled** to **ECMAScript 2023** (or lower).
- Your plugin **_MUST!!!_** be written in TypeScript to keep your sanity.

## 🔐 Plugin Verification & Trust

To ensure the safety and authenticity of plugins in SnapX, all plugins must be **cryptographically verifiable**.

---

### 📄 File Integrity & Signing Requirements

Every plugin must meet the following criteria:

- ✅ **Each file inside the plugin ZIP must:**
    - Have a corresponding `.sha512` file (e.g. `main.js` → `main.js.sha512`).
    - Have a detached `.asc` OpenPGP signature (e.g. `main.js` → `main.js.asc`) created using your trusted key.

> [!WARNING]
> This applies to **every single file** — not just the main files. Even metadata files or assets must be signed and hashed.

---

### ⚠️ What Happens Without Verification?

If a plugin lacks proper signatures and checksums:

**Users will see this warning:**

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is unsigned and may be unsafe. SnapX cannot verify who made it or if it was tampered with. \
> Proceeding is NOT recommended unless you fully trust the source.

> 🛑 **This is not like a typical unsigned executable warning you might see on Windows.**  
> In SnapX,
> developers can **without cost prove their identity** using cryptographic keys tied to platforms like GitHub,
> Keybase, Mailvelope, or email.  
> If they haven’t taken this **basic verification step**, we strongly discourage trusting or installing their plugin —
> especially if it's distributed outside of official channels or our plugin registry.

### 🧾 Ways to Reduce the Warning Severity

The scary warning will become more **neutral** if:

- The plugin is signed using a **Keybase** account that has proof of owning the OpenPGP Key.
- The author's OpenPGP key is **published on Mailvelope’s keyserver** (https://keys.mailvelope.com).
- The plugin follows all structural guidelines and hash signing expectations.

The warning will look like this:

> [!NOTE]
> **This plugin is signed but the publisher’s identity is not fully verified.**  
> The plugin is safe from tampering, but please only install it if you trust the source.

### 🌐 Verified Publishers

Developers can **upgrade to Verified Publisher** status by submitting their identity for review.

- **One-time fee:** $20 USD
- **Privacy-friendly:** We use a minimal and ethical identity verification method. No IDs, no pictures of your face.
- **Perks:**
    - No warnings shown during plugin installation.
    - A **checkmark badge** will appear next to the plugin and author name, signaling trustworthiness to users.
    - Listed in the SnapX registry as a **Trusted Publisher**.
    - Plugins are favored in search results and trending lists. (ranked by a scoring system that balances Verified status with user ratings, recent updates, and overall popularity to ensure fairness)
    - Verified Publishers can formally contest and respond to reviews on their plugins, with contested reviews verified by moderators to ensure fairness.
    - Given Trusted Plugin Publisher role in SnapX Discord server.
    - Helps offset **infrastructure and administrative costs** to keep SnapX free and community-focused.

## Plugin Structure

Plugins may consist of multiple `.js` files. There's no requirement to bundle everything into one file, though bundling is allowed.

The entry point (e.g., `main.js`) and related files should be declared clearly. SnapX will evaluate all relevant files in order.

```
plugins/
└── hello-world.zip
    ├── main.js                ← Compiled ES2023 JavaScript
    ├── main.js.sig            ← Signature for main.js
    ├── main.js.sha512         ← SHA-512 checksum of main.js
    ├── metadata.json5         ← Metadata: name, description, source link, license, icon, etc.
    ├── metadata.json5.sig     ← Signature for metadata.json5
    ├── metadata.json5.sha512  ← SHA-512 checksum of metadata.json5
    ├── icon.png               ← Plugin icon (recommended size e.g. 128x128 or 256x256)
    ├── icon.png.sig           ← Signature for icon.png
    ├── icon.png.sha512        ← SHA-512 checksum of icon.png
```

## 🧪 Plugin Publishing Experiment for SnapX

## 🧠 Core Design Goals

- Prevent name collisions and impersonation
- Enable decentralized fallback and offline-first usage
- Detect and block suspicious or malicious plugins
- Keep publishing simple and traceable for developers

---

## 🔐 Auth-Based Identity (Planned)

Plugin authors can log in with:

- ✅ GitHub
- ✅ Keybase

No passwords. All plugin uploads will be associated with a verifiable identity.

---

## 🏛 Central Plugin Registry (Planned)

A central registry will serve as the **source of truth** for plugin metadata and name ownership.

- Enforces **unique global names**
- Supports **namespaced publishing** (e.g., `@BrycensRanch/my-plugin`)
- Stores plugin metadata, version history, digital signature info
- Validates uploaded ZIPs and maintains a searchable index

---

## 📛 Plugin Naming Rules (Proposed)

| Name Type       | Rule                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Global Name     | Must be unique (e.g., `awesome-ocr`)               |
| Namespaced Name | Always allowed (e.g., `@BrycensRanch/awesome-ocr`) |

---

## 📌 Name Reservation

Plugin names can be **reserved** for 72 hours during development, to avoid last-minute name sniping. If the name is unavailable, you can still publish under your own namespace.

---

## 📦 Plugins as ZIP Files

All plugins are bundled as standard `.zip` archives.

Each plugin ZIP contains:
- A signed manifest (`manifest.json5`)
- Signed Files (main.js, png, etc.)

This format makes distribution portable and easy to verify.

---

## 🛰 Offline Plugin Manifest Caching

When SnapX is **built with an internet connection**, it will:

- Download and embed a **snapshot of the plugin registry** into the build
- This cached manifest enables **offline plugin browsing**, including names, authors, descriptions, and download URLs

> [!NOTE]
>  If our servers go offline, SnapX users can still discover and install plugins that are hosted elsewhere — like GitHub — as long as they’re listed in the last cached manifest.

---

## 🔏 Optional Plugin Signing

Plugin authors may optionally sign plugin archives using a public/private keypair.

- The plugin registry binds your **public key** to your plugin
- SnapX will verify the signature at installation time
- Prevents tampering and spoofed updates

---

## 🛡️ Plugin Security & Malware Detection (Planned)

To protect users, all uploaded plugins will be scanned for suspicious behavior patterns, including:

- ❗ Minified or obfuscated code without source maps
- ❗ Use of `eval`, `Function`, or dynamic code execution
- ❗ Extrapolated strings or suspicious escape sequences
- ❗ Known malicious payloads or telemetry abuse

> [!NOTE]
> Suspicious plugins may be blocked or flagged for review before being listed in the registry.

---

## 👮 Moderation & Disputes

- Community reports can flag plugins for review
- Volunteers are accepted, providing there is not an obvious conflict of interest
- Plugin takedowns may occur in cases of impersonation, malware, or broken functionality
- Plugin name disputes will be resolved based on first-claim or reservation ownership


## 🧪 Current Status

This is a **design experiment** — not a production service (yet). Everything here is subject to change based on testing, feedback, and community needs.
